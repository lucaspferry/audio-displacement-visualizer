##  General Info
This add-on was created for my end project in the degree of Multimedia Engineering at the University of Valencia.

## Use
This add-on provides a way to create music visualizers using .wav files and displacement maps in Blender.

## Restrictions
* Windows 10
* Blender 2.83 LTS
* .wav files (8 or 16 bits)
* Dependencies need to be installed (Librosa)
* Admin privileges need to be granted for installation

## Info
* Short audio files work the best (< 5 minutes)
* Use a reasonable sample amount (Add-on could become unresponsive)
* Blender could get hung because of the size of the file and number of samples
* On installation, Blender could appear as freezed (Open Blender console before installation to see progress) - It can take some time
